I'm a postdoc in the [Computational and Biological Learning lab](https://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, working with Máté Lengyel. Prior to that, I did my PhD with Constantin Rothkopf the [Psychology of Information Processing group](https://www.pip.tu-darmstadt.de/ag_pip/index.en.jsp) at the [Centre for Cognitive Science](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/cogsci/ccs/index.en.jsp), TU Darmstadt.

My work is focused on probabilistic models of perception and action in naturalistic sequential tasks. To understand the uncertainties, intrinsic costs of behavior, and subjective internal models involved in these tasks, I develop and apply computational modeling techniques including inverse optimal control and Bayesian inference.
